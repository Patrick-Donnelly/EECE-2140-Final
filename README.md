# EECE-2140-Final by Patrick J. Donnelly
My submission to Prof. Roi Yehoshua and the TAs as my thesis for the class EECE 2140 at Northeastern University

This program requires Python version 3.9.12 or later, as well as the Tk Interface package.

The program is a fully-functional chess program with support for all standard moves, including castling and en passant,
as well as check identification, but does not support the enforcement thereof, nor does it identify checkmates.
